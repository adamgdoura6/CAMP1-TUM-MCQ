        "A": "Because X-rays penetrate matter uniformly",

      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Slide \"CT – Terminology\" states: \"Generating 3D image of the inside of an object from multiple 2D X-Ray images taken around a single axis of rotation.\" The rotation provides angular diversity needed for reconstruction."
