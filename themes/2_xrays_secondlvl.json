      "text": "Why does increasing X-ray photon energy generally reduce image contrast between soft tissues?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Higher energy photons increase photoelectric absorption differences",
        "B": "Higher energy photons reduce Compton scattering",
        "C": "Higher energy photons reduce differential attenuation",
        "D": "Higher energy photons increase detector efficiency"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "From the slides on interaction with matter: image contrast arises from differences in attenuation. At higher energies, attenuation coefficients of different soft tissues become more similar, reducing contrast."

      "id": "q33",
      "text": "Why is photoelectric absorption more useful than Compton scattering for generating image contrast in medical X-ray imaging?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Photoelectric absorption is elastic",
        "B": "Photoelectric absorption correlates with electron density",
        "C": "Compton scattering dominates at low energies",
        "D": "Compton scattering increases contrast"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Physics — Photoelectric absorption\": \"Correlates with the electron density. Thus the more dense the material the stronger the absorption.\" This density dependence creates contrast between tissues."

      "text": "Why does bone appear bright in X-ray images while air appears dark?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bone emits X-rays while air absorbs them",
        "B": "Bone causes Compton scattering while air causes absorption",
        "C": "Bone has higher electron density leading to stronger absorption",
        "D": "Air reflects X-rays"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Physics — Photoelectric absorption\": \"Bones absorb more X-rays – soft tissue absorb less.\" Air absorbs almost none, so many photons reach the detector."

      "text": "Why are rotating anodes necessary in modern X-ray tubes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To increase photon energy",
        "B": "To focus the electron beam",
        "C": "To distribute heat over a larger surface",
        "D": "To reduce Compton scattering"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Physics — Modern tubes\": \"The anode degrades over time. Thus, modern tubes use line focus cathodes and rotating anodes.\" Rotation spreads heat and reduces damage."

      "text": "Why can photon-counting detectors filter out electronic noise more effectively than energy-integrating detectors?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They integrate over longer exposure times",
        "B": "They measure phase instead of intensity",
        "C": "They apply an energy threshold per photon",
        "D": "They use scintillators"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Photon counting detectors\": \"Energy of each photon is recorded – Allows to filter out electronic noise.\" Noise events typically fall below the energy threshold."
    },
    {
      "id": "q37",
      "text": "Why are energy-integrating detectors unable to provide spectral information?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They discard low-energy photons",
        "B": "They sum all photon energies together",
        "C": "They only detect visible light",
        "D": "They operate only in fluoroscopy"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Energy integrating detectors\": \"Intensity reflects the integrated energy of all photons over a certain amount of time.\" Individual photon energies are lost."

        "B": "They required synchrotron radiation",
        "C": "They could not detect absorption",
        "D": "They required MRI scanners"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Phase-contrast X-ray imaging\": \"Classic approaches require a synchrotron and monochromatic X-rays.\" This limited clinical feasibility."

        "C": "It models Compton scattering only",
        "D": "It applies only to visible light"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Slides \"Mathematics — Interaction with matter\": attenuation is expressed as an integral of linear attenuation coefficients along a path, which is exactly what CT reconstructs."

      "text": "Why is Compton scattering problematic for image quality?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It increases absorption contrast",
        "B": "It removes photons from the beam direction",
        "C": "It creates additional ionization",
        "D": "It increases spatial resolution"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "From the interaction slides: Compton scattering is inelastic and deflects photons, causing them to reach the detector at incorrect positions, reducing image contrast."

      "id": "q42",
      "text": "Why can phase-contrast imaging reveal structures invisible in absorption-based X-ray images?",

        "B": "Phase changes occur even when absorption differences are small",
        "C": "Phase-contrast uses higher radiation dose",
        "D": "Phase replaces attenuation physics"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Slide \"Phase-contrast X-ray imaging\": \"Electromagnetic waves have more properties than just intensity – Waves also have a phase.\" Phase variations can be detected even when absorption is weak."
